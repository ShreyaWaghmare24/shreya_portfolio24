      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science with Honors in Cybersecurity.</p><p>My focus lies in digital forensics.I’m drawn to problems that don’t have immediate answers and systems that don’t want to be understood.</p>

  <p>Outside the cyberworld, I’m someone who sketches when thoughts feel too loud, reads when I want to meet minds unlike mine, and often loses track of time exploring human behavior through the lens of social psychology. I believe the best investigators are curious about both people and machines — and I try to be both.</p>
